### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris and I like building software, here are some projects that I've worked on in the past.

### MasterMind

Repositories:
- https://github.com/chrismlittle123/mastermind
- https://github.com/chrismlittle123/mastermind-api

A quiz game like the British TV show MasterMind, where you answer questions from my bank of knowledge and an LLM is used to determine whether the answers are correct or not.
