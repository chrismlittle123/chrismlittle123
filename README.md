### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris and I love working with data, here are some projects that I've worked on in the past.

### Shipping API

Repository:

An API that lets you retrieve data from the EU-MRV public CO2 emission report:

https://mrv.emsa.europa.eu/#public/emission-report

You can interact with this API using this streamlit app:

### Bar Database

As part of an analytics engineering test I built a cocktail database using the Cocktail DB API:
